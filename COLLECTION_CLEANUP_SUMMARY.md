# 🗑️ Collection Cleanup Summary

## ✅ **Successfully Removed Collections**

The following unwanted collections have been permanently removed from your MongoDB database:

- **`users`** - Old users collection (replaced by `adminUsers` and `regularUsers`)
- **`media`** - Unused media collection
- **`payload-locked-document`** - PayloadCMS leftover
- **`payload-locked-documents`** - PayloadCMS leftover (plural)
- **`payload-migrations`** - PayloadCMS leftover
- **`payload-preferences`** - PayloadCMS leftover
- **`verification-codes`** - Unused verification system leftover

## 🔍 **Root Causes Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **`users` Collection**

- **Cause**: Your `setup-db-indexes.mjs` script was creating indexes on it
- **Fixed**: Removed all references to `users` collection from setup scripts
- **Result**: Collection won't be recreated by your application

### 2. **`media` Collection**

- **Cause**: Your `setup-db-indexes.mjs` script was creating indexes on it
- **Fixed**: Removed all references to `media` collection from setup scripts
- **Result**: Collection won't be recreated by your application

### 3. **`payload-*` Collections**

- **Cause**: Leftover artifacts from when you had PayloadCMS installed
- **Fixed**: No code was actively creating these - they were just leftover
- **Result**: Collections won't be recreated since PayloadCMS is completely removed

### 4. **`verification-codes` Collection**

- **Cause**: Leftover from your old email verification system
- **Fixed**: No active code references this collection
- **Result**: Collection won't be recreated

## 🛡️ **Why Collections Won't Come Back**

### **Code Changes Made:**

1. ✅ Removed `users` collection references from `scripts/setup-db-indexes.mjs`
2. ✅ Removed `media` collection references from `scripts/setup-db-indexes.mjs`
3. ✅ Removed `users` collection references from `src/app/(app)/api/test-db/route.ts`
4. ✅ Deleted `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-users.mjs` (was referencing old `users` collection)
5. ✅ Updated collections list in setup script to only include needed collections

### **No Active Creation Sources:**

- ❌ No NextAuth database adapters configured
- ❌ No PayloadCMS dependencies or configurations
- ❌ No database initialization scripts creating these collections
- ❌ No application code referencing these collections

## 📊 **Current Database State**

### **Remaining Collections (These are KEPT):**

- **`adminUsers`** - Your admin users
- **`regularUsers`** - Your regular users
- **`categories`** - Equipment categories
- **`equipment`** - Your equipment data

### **Collections Successfully Removed:**

- **`users`** ✅
- **`media`** ✅
- **`payload-locked-document`** ✅
- **`payload-locked-documents`** ✅
- **`payload-migrations`** ✅
- **`payload-preferences`** ✅
- **`verification-codes`** ✅

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Test Your Application**

- Start your development server
- Verify all functionality still works
- Check that no errors appear in console

### **2. Monitor Database**

- The collections should remain deleted
- If any reappear, run the cleanup script again:
  ```bash
  bun scripts/remove-unwanted-collections.mjs
  ```

### **3. Git Commit**

- Commit these changes to prevent future issues
- The cleanup script is now part of your project for future use

## 🔧 **Maintenance**

### **If Collections Reappear:**

1. Run the cleanup script: `bun scripts/remove-unwanted-collections.mjs`
2. Check for any new code that might be creating them
3. The script will show you exactly what's happening

### **Adding New Collections:**

- Only create collections you actually need
- Avoid creating collections just for testing
- Use the existing collections (`adminUsers`, `regularUsers`, `categories`, `equipment`)

## 📝 **Scripts Available**

- **`scripts/remove-unwanted-collections.mjs`** - Remove unwanted collections
- **`scripts/setup-db-indexes.mjs`** - Set up indexes for needed collections only

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All unwanted collections have been permanently removed and won't reappear.
