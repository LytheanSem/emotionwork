- [x] Email format validation
- [x] Phone number validation
- [x] File type and size validation
- [x] Request size limits (1MB API, 10MB uploads)
- [x] Enhanced stage booking validation

### Database Security
- [x] MongoDB with ObjectId validation
- [x] NoSQL injection protection
- [x] User data isolation
- [x] Admin privilege checks

### File Upload Security
- [x] Cloudinary integration
- [x] Server-side file validation
- [x] File type restrictions
- [x] File size limits (100MB max)

### Security Headers
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- [x] Referrer-Policy
- [x] X-Download-Options: noopen
- [x] X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none

### Rate Limiting
- [x] Admin rate limiting (100 req/15min)
- [x] General API rate limiting (10 req/15min)
- [x] Request size validation

## ⚠️ **RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS**

### 1. Production Logging
**Priority**: High
**Action**: 
- Remove console.log statements from production
- Implement structured logging with log levels
- Use the existing logger utility in `src/lib/logger.ts`

### 2. Environment Variables Audit
**Priority**: Medium
**Action**:
- Review all environment variables
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed to client-side
- Consider using a secrets management service

### 3. API Documentation
**Priority**: Medium
**Action**:
- Document all API endpoints
- Add rate limiting documentation
- Include security requirements

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting
**Priority**: High
**Action**:
- Implement error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Set up security alerts
- Monitor failed authentication attempts

### 5. Backup & Recovery
**Priority**: High
**Action**:
- Implement automated database backups
- Test recovery procedures
- Document disaster recovery plan

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY TASKS**

### Immediate (Next 24 hours)
1. **Remove console.log from production builds**
2. **Set up error monitoring**
3. **Review and rotate API keys if needed**

### Short-term (Next week)
1. **Implement automated security scanning**
2. **Set up database backups**
3. **Create security incident response plan**

### Long-term (Next month)
1. **Conduct penetration testing**
2. **Implement security audit logging**
3. **Set up automated vulnerability scanning**

## 🔍 **SECURITY TESTING CHECKLIST**

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] Test authorization escalation
- [ ] Test input validation with malicious payloads
- [ ] Test file upload with malicious files
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Set up OWASP ZAP scanning
- [ ] Implement security unit tests
- [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure automated security headers testing

## 📋 **ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC SECURITY**

### Development
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] Database access restricted
- [x] Debug logging enabled (remove for production)

### Staging
- [ ] Production-like security configuration
- [ ] Security testing environment
- [ ] Staging data sanitization

### Production
- [ ] All security headers enabled
- [ ] Error monitoring active
- [ ] Backup systems operational
- [ ] Security incident response ready

## 🛡️ **SECURITY MONITORING**

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- File upload anomalies
- Database query performance
- Error rates and types

### Alert Thresholds
- > 10 failed logins per minute per IP
- > 100 API requests per minute per user
- File uploads > 50MB
- Database queries > 5 seconds
- Error rate > 5%

## 📞 **INCIDENT RESPONSE**

### Security Incident Contacts
- Primary: [Your Security Team]
- Secondary: [Your DevOps Team]
- Escalation: [Your Management Team]

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Short-term**: Assess and contain threat
3. **Long-term**: Investigate and remediate
4. **Post-incident**: Document and improve
